1.7) a. log X < X for all X > 0
				Supposing log base 2,
				Base: log 1 < 1
									0 < 1
				Suppose for some X > 0, log X >= X, we'll call this X, Y.  
				Then log Y >= Y, however 2^Y <= Y is clearly not true.
				By contradiction log X < X for all X > 0

			b. Prove that: log A^B = B (log A)
				 let C = log A
						 2^C = A
						 (2^C)^B = A^B <--- Bring in B
						 2^CB = A^B
						 log 2^CB = log A^B
						 CB = log A^B
						 B (log A) = log A^B


1.8) skipped for on paper i suppose
