2. Regarding memory bottlenecks in suffix tree construction:
		The "block streaming model" they use takes advantage of paging techniques used by virtual memory. A disk access machine is set up such
		that it contains an arbitrarily large disk broken into block, these blocks are known as disk pages. The disk access machine also contains
		a processor and internal memory of size M. Each disk page contains B items, and is no larger than M/2. When a page is moved to the 
		internal memory this is referred to as an I/O. On disk access, a single page is swapped into internal memory, this is a single I/O.
		In conclusion, the paper closes with that optimally sorting at O( (n/DB) logM/B (n/M) ), we are able to optimally construct the suffix
		tree of S in a PDAM model in the same O amount of I/Os. The largest bottleneck coming from RAM to DAM was the sorting, and dealing with
		memory on disk as opposed to ram. An exploit is used as well, that is that contiguous page access tends to perform better than random 
		page access. They also show that we are able to achieve O(n log n) time constructing the suffix tree on a PDAM model, which of course is 
		the best we are able to do for sorting.
