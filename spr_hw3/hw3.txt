9.3) Write a program to perform a topological sort on a graph.
 
9.9) Write a program to solve the single-source shortest-path problem.

9.15) a. Find a minimum spanning tree for the graph in Figure 9.84 
         using both Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms.
      
      b. Is this minimum spanning tree unique? Why?
         
9.16) Does either Prim’s or Kruskal’s algorithm work if there are 
      negative edge weights? 

9.32) a. Write a program to find an Euler circuit in a graph if one 
         exists.
      
      b. Write a program to find an Euler tour in a graph if one 
         exists.

9.46) Section 8.7 described the generating of mazes. Suppose we want 
      to output the path in the maze. Assume that the maze is 
      represented as a matrix; each cell in the matrix stores 
      information about what walls are present (or absent).

      a. Write a program that computes enough information to output a 
         path in the maze. Give output in the form SEN...
         (representing go south, then east, then north, etc.).

      b. If you are using a C++ compiler with a windowing package, 
         write a program that draws the maze and, at the press of a 
         button, draws the path.

9.54) The clique problem can be stated as follows: Given an 
      undirected graph, G = (V, E), and an integer, K, does G contain 
      a complete subgraph of at least K vertices? The vertex cover 
      problem can be stated as follows: Given an undirected graph,
      G = (V, E), and an integer, K, does G contain a subset V ⊂ V 
      such that |V| ≤ K and every edge in G has a vertex in V ? Show 
      that the clique problem is polynomially reducible to vertex 
      cover.
